        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>
            The works of José Rizal were deeply rooted in the historical realities of the late 19th century, a time when 
            the Philippines was under Spanish colonial rule. Spain had governed the archipelago for over three centuries, 
            imposing strict policies that limited the rights and freedoms of Filipinos. The Spanish government and the 
            Catholic Church controlled education, the economy, and the political system, leaving native Filipinos with 
            little to no influence in their own country.
        </p>
        <p>
            During this time, Filipinos were classified into different social classes. The **peninsulares** were Spaniards 
            born in Spain, holding the highest government positions. The **insulares** were Spaniards born in the Philippines, 
            enjoying privileges but still regarded as inferior to the peninsulares. The **mestizos** (mixed-race Filipinos) 
            and the **indios** (native Filipinos) were the most discriminated against, suffering from oppression, forced labor, 
            and excessive taxation. Education was accessible only to the elite, and even then, it was heavily influenced by 
            Spanish friars, who used it as a tool for religious indoctrination rather than enlightenment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rizal, born in 1861, grew up witnessing the injustices suffered by his people. He was highly influenced by the 
            writings of European thinkers like Voltaire, Rousseau, and the liberal ideas of the French Revolution. As a young 
            man, he studied in the Philippines before traveling to Spain, France, and Germany, where he encountered the 
            principles of democracy, nationalism, and human rights. Inspired by these ideas, Rizal used his literary skills 
            to expose the truth about Spanish abuses in the Philippines.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1887, Rizal published *Noli Me Tangere*, a novel that depicted the corrupt practices of the Spanish clergy and 
            government officials. The book was banned in the Philippines, and its possession was considered a crime. Despite 
            this, it circulated underground, fueling the growing desire for reform among Filipinos. In 1891, Rizal released 
            its sequel, *El Filibusterismo*, which took on a darker tone, advocating for radical change rather than peaceful 
            reform. His works inspired Filipino revolutionaries, most notably the **Katipunan**, an underground resistance 
            movement founded by **Andrés Bonifacio** in 1892.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Spanish authorities saw Rizal as a major threat. In 1892, he was exiled to Dapitan in Mindanao, where he 
            continued his studies and humanitarian work. By 1896, the Philippine Revolution had begun, and although Rizal 
            did not directly participate, he was arrested and falsely accused of inciting the rebellion. On **December 30, 1896**, 
            he was executed by firing squad in **Bagumbayan** (now Luneta Park), solidifying his status as a national hero. 
            His literary works continue to be a testament to his love for the country and his vision of a free Philippines.

        <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
        <p>
            "Noli Me Tangere" tells the story of "Crisostomo Ibarra", a young Filipino who returns to the Philippines after 
            studying in Europe. His return is met with optimism, as he hopes to bring progress and enlightenment to his 
            countrymen. However, he quickly realizes that the Spanish authorities and the powerful friars control the society, 
            using religion and oppression to maintain their dominance. His father, Don Rafael Ibarra, was unjustly accused of 
            rebellion and died in prison. The friars, particularly "Padre Damaso", hold a deep hatred for his family.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ibarra's love for "Maria Clara", the supposed daughter of Capitan Tiago, is also tested. He discovers that she 
            is actually the illegitimate daughter of Padre Damaso, a secret that eventually forces her into the convent. 
            Meanwhile, "Elias", a mysterious revolutionary, warns Ibarra of the growing unrest among the Filipinos, but 
            Ibarra remains hopeful in peaceful reforms. However, after being framed for rebellion, Ibarra is forced to flee, 
            leaving behind his dreams and the woman he loves.
        </p>
        <p>
            "El Filibusterismo", the sequel, presents a drastically different Ibarra. Now disguised as "Simoun", a wealthy 
            jeweler, he returns to the Philippines with vengeance in his heart. He secretly aids revolutionaries while 
            influencing government officials for his own agenda. His ultimate plan is to detonate a bomb during a wedding 
            attended by the Spanish elite, symbolizing the destruction of the corrupt system. However, his plot is foiled 
            when "Basilio", a young medical student and the brother of the martyred Sisa, warns the people.
        </p>
        <p>
            Simoun, wounded and defeated, seeks refuge with a priest before consuming poison to end his life. In his dying 
            moments, he reflects on his actions, questioning whether revenge was truly the right path. The novel ends with 
            a sense of unresolved conflict, mirroring the real-life struggles of the Filipino people against Spanish rule.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rizal’s novels serve as both a historical record and a warning, showcasing the deep inequalities and injustices 
            that fueled the Philippine Revolution. His works remain essential reading in Philippine literature, serving as 
            a reminder of the sacrifices made for freedom.
